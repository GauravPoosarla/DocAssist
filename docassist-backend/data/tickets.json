    "description": "### Link to the code that reproduces this issue\n\nhttps://github.com/azu/next-prefetch-txt-bug\n\n### To Reproduce\n\nSource Code: https://github.com/azu/next-prefetch-txt-bug\n\n1. Open https://next-prefetch-txt-bug.vercel.app/ in your browser\n3. Open Chrome DevTools and go to the Network tab\n4. Click on \"Normal Page Link (with prefetch)\" to trigger initial prefetch\n5. Block the request URL `https://next-prefetch-txt-bug.vercel.app/test-page.txt` in DevTools\n6. Click the \"Normal Page Link (with prefetch)\" link again\n7. Unexpectedly, the browser navigates to `/test-page.txt`\n\nVideo:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed697dbe-9dfd-452d-a61a-7bb2edf184a6\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n- Navigation should go to `/test-page` and display the normal page component\n- Users should see the rendered React page\n\n**Actual behavior:**\n- Instead of navigating to `/test-page`, the browser navigates to `/test-page.txt`\n- The browser displays the raw RSC (React Server Component) payload code instead of the rendered page\n- This happens when prefetch fails and the system falls back to hard navigation\n\nThis issue affects multiple navigation methods:\n1. Next.js Link component with prefetch={true}\n2. router.replace() and router.push() programmatic navigation\n\nThe problem appears to be that when these navigation methods fail and fall back to hard navigation, they incorrectly append `.txt` to the URL and serve the RSC payload instead of performing proper page navigation.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: darwin\n  Arch: arm64\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 24.5.0: Tue Apr 22 19:54:43 PDT 2025; root:xnu-11417.121.6~2/RELEASE_ARM64_T8132\n  Available memory (MB): 32768\n  Available CPU cores: 10\nBinaries:\n  Node: 22.18.0\n  npm: 10.9.3\n  Yarn: 1.22.21\n  pnpm: 10.4.1\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.4.5 // Latest available version is detected (15.4.5).\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\n  react: 19.1.0\n  react-dom: 19.1.0\n  typescript: 5.9.2\nNext.js Config:\n  output: export\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?

When fetch fails, the fallback uses the mutated `url` with `.txt` extension and navigate it",

Use Next.js 15.4.3 and sitecore-jss 22.8.0.\n2.
