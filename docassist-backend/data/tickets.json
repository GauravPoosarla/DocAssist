    "description": "### Link to the code that reproduces this issue\n\nhttps://github.com/azu/next-prefetch-txt-bug\n\n### To Reproduce\n\nSource Code: https://github.com/azu/next-prefetch-txt-bug\n\n1. Open https://next-prefetch-txt-bug.vercel.app/ in your browser\n3. Open Chrome DevTools and go to the Network tab\n4. Click on \"Normal Page Link (with prefetch)\" to trigger initial prefetch\n5. Block the request URL `https://next-prefetch-txt-bug.vercel.app/test-page.txt` in DevTools\n6. Click the \"Normal Page Link (with prefetch)\" link again\n7. Unexpectedly, the browser navigates to `/test-page.txt`\n\nVideo:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed697dbe-9dfd-452d-a61a-7bb2edf184a6\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n- Navigation should go to `/test-page` and display the normal page component\n- Users should see the rendered React page\n\n**Actual behavior:**\n- Instead of navigating to `/test-page`, the browser navigates to `/test-page.txt`\n- The browser displays the raw RSC (React Server Component) payload code instead of the rendered page\n- This happens when prefetch fails and the system falls back to hard navigation\n\nThis issue affects multiple navigation methods:\n1. Next.js Link component with prefetch={true}\n2. router.replace() and router.push() programmatic navigation\n\nThe problem appears to be that when these navigation methods fail and fall back to hard navigation, they incorrectly append `.txt` to the URL and serve the RSC payload instead of performing proper page navigation.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\n  Platform: darwin\n  Arch: arm64\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 24.5.0: Tue Apr 22 19:54:43 PDT 2025; root:xnu-11417.121.6~2/RELEASE_ARM64_T8132\n  Available memory (MB): 32768\n  Available CPU cores: 10\nBinaries:\n  Node: 22.18.0\n  npm: 10.9.3\n  Yarn: 1.22.21\n  pnpm: 10.4.1\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.4.5 // Latest available version is detected (15.4.5).\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\n  react: 19.1.0\n  react-dom: 19.1.0\n  typescript: 5.9.2\nNext.js Config:\n  output: export\n```\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?

(Select all that apply)\n\nnext build (local), next start (local), Vercel (Deployed), Other (Deployed)\n\n### Additional context\n\nIn Reproduce Step, I reproducing the issue using network blocks, but\nin reality, when deploying a static site, we have encountered cases where the .txt file is changed, causing the retrieval of the .txt file to fail and the same issue to occur.\nTo summarize, we have encountered an issue where, after deployment, we are suddenly navigated to a URL such as `/path/to/page.txt`.\n\n\nThe issue stems from the URL mutation timing:\n\n1. https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/46674 added MPA navigation fallback for failed RSC payload fetches\n2. https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/75671 unintentionally moved the `.txt` extension logic to mutate the original `url` variable before the fetch attempt\n3. When fetch fails, the fallback uses the mutated `url` with `.txt` extension and navigate it",
